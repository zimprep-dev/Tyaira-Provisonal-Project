# Subscription Logic Fix - Documentation

## Problem Statement
Users who cancelled their subscription after taking more than 10 tests were unable to continue using the platform, even though they should have access during their paid period and be able to use the free tier afterward.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a grace period system that allows users to:
1. **Retain premium access** until the end of their billing period after cancellation
2. **Return to free tier** after the grace period expires
3. **Continue using the platform** with free tier limits (10 tests) after subscription ends

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update (`models.py`)
- **Added field**: `subscription_end_date` - tracks when subscription access expires
- **Added method**: `has_active_subscription()` - checks if user has active access (including grace period)

```python
def has_active_subscription(self):
    """Check if user has an active subscription (including grace period after cancellation)"""
    if not self.is_subscriber and not self.subscription_end_date:
        return False
    
    # If subscription is active
    if self.is_subscriber:
        return True
    
    # If subscription was cancelled but still within the paid period
    if self.subscription_end_date and datetime.utcnow() < self.subscription_end_date:
        return True
    
    return False
```

### 2. Subscription Management (`app.py`)

#### Subscribe Route
- Sets `subscription_end_date` to 30 days from subscription date
- Users get immediate access and a 30-day billing period

#### Cancel Subscription Route
- Sets `is_subscriber = False` but **keeps** `subscription_end_date`
- Users retain access until `subscription_end_date`
- Shows clear message: "You will retain premium access until [date]"

#### Access Control Updates
All subscription checks now use `has_active_subscription()` instead of `is_subscriber`:
- `/api/test/start/<category>` - Test limit checking
- `/test_interface/<category>` - Test access
- `/download_pdf/<file_id>` - Download limits

### 3. UI Updates

#### Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)
- Shows "Premium (Cancelled)" status for users in grace period
- Displays "Ending Soon" for subscription stat
- Only shows upgrade prompt when grace period expires

#### Profile (`profile.html`)
- Shows "Premium (Cancelled)" badge with end date
- Displays: "Access until [date]" for cancelled subscriptions
- Only shows upgrade section after grace period expires

### 4. Migration Files

#### Database Migration
- `migrations/versions/add_subscription_end_date.py` - Alembic migration
- `apply_subscription_migration.py` - Helper script to apply changes

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Run the Migration Script
```bash
python apply_subscription_migration.py
```

This will:
- Add the `subscription_end_date` column to the database
- Update existing subscribers with appropriate end dates
- Verify the migration was successful

### Step 2: Restart the Application
```bash
# Stop the current Flask app
# Then restart it
python app.py
```

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
1. **Test Subscription Cancellation**:
   - Subscribe a test user
   - Cancel the subscription
   - Verify they still have access
   - Check the end date is displayed correctly

2. **Test Grace Period Expiry**:
   - Manually set `subscription_end_date` to a past date
   - Verify user returns to free tier
   - Confirm they can take up to 10 tests

3. **Test Free Tier Limits**:
   - Create a new free user
   - Take 10 tests
   - Verify 11th test is blocked with proper message

## User Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Active Subscriber
- `is_subscriber = True`
- `subscription_end_date = 2025-11-06`
- **Result**: Unlimited access ✅

### Scenario 2: Cancelled Subscription (Grace Period)
- `is_subscriber = False`
- `subscription_end_date = 2025-11-06` (future date)
- **Result**: Unlimited access until end date ✅
- **Display**: "Premium (Cancelled) - Access until Nov 6, 2025"

### Scenario 3: Expired Subscription
- `is_subscriber = False`
- `subscription_end_date = 2025-09-06` (past date)
- **Result**: Free tier access (10 tests) ✅
- **Display**: "Free Tier"

### Scenario 4: Never Subscribed
- `is_subscriber = False`
- `subscription_end_date = None`
- **Result**: Free tier access (10 tests) ✅
- **Display**: "Free Tier"

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users get what they paid for - access until billing period ends
2. **Fair Access**: Cancelled users can return to free tier instead of being locked out
3. **Clear Communication**: UI shows exact status and end dates
4. **Business Logic**: Proper subscription lifecycle management

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] New subscriptions set end date correctly
- [ ] Cancellation keeps access during grace period
- [ ] Grace period expiry returns user to free tier
- [ ] Free tier limits work correctly (10 tests)
- [ ] UI displays correct status badges
- [ ] Download limits respect subscription status
- [ ] Test limits respect subscription status
- [ ] Profile page shows accurate information
- [ ] Dashboard reflects current access level

## Dependencies

Ensure `python-dateutil` is installed:
```bash
pip install python-dateutil
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting the code changes
2. Running the down migration:
```bash
flask db downgrade
```

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Email notifications before subscription ends
- Automatic renewal option
- Subscription history tracking
- Analytics on cancellation reasons
